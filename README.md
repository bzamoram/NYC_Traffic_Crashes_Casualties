### New York Traffic Crashes Caualties (2012-2024)

The goal of this project is to leverage the principles of data mining to construct a model aimed at predicting whether a traffic incident in New York City will lead to casualties. 
By harnessing the knowledge and skills acquired through data mining course through the semester, we aspire to develop a model endowed with a high degree of accuracy in its predictions.

The significance of this project lies in its potential to influence road safety measures and inform more responsible driving. Accurate predictions regarding the risk and aftermath of traffic 
collisions are crucial for implementing targeted preventive strategies, heightening public awareness, and refining emergency response protocols.
